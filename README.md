# twitter-sentiment-analysis

Twitter sentiment analysis and information visualizations developed using Python. Sentiment analysis performed on a dataset of 450 tweets related to climate change; Tweets collected from hashtags #ClimateChange, #ClimateEmergency, #ClimateCrisis. Scatterplot with linear regression line generated to investigate correlation between sentiment (positive/neutral/negative) and engagement (“retweets”). Final project completed for INFX 287 Problem Solving with Data.

## Goal 
To investigate the correlation between sentiment (positive/neutral/negative) and engagement (“retweets”) of Tweets related to climate change. 

## Data
Real-time Tweets collected from hashtags #ClimateChange, #ClimateEmergency, #ClimateCrisis (150 Tweets each). Merged dataset of 450 Tweets total related to climate change. Data scraped from Twitter API courtesy of instructor.
